"""A Bank ATM Simulation is a software project that mimics the operations of a real-life ATM (Automated Teller Machine). The simulation allows users to perform various banking tasks like:

✅ Withdrawing money
✅ Depositing money
✅ Checking account balance
✅ Changing PIN
✅ Transferring funds

It's essentially a program that simulates how an ATM interacts with a bank account system."""
